## About The Project

This project is a React-Redux capstone project based on the catalog of statistics. Build a developer job searching website, which has a real world application for many developers like myself. This catalog of the job gets its data from the [GitHub Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api), and data are retrieved through the redux store. I include a filter to search for jobs by location or description. The webpage consists of two pages using a unique route within a single web application. The first-page shows several lists of jobs, and the second-page shows information about a specific job.
